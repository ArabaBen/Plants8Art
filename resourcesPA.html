				<div id="notas"><h2> College Mental Health Study</h2><p>Mental health problems represent a potentially important but relatively unexplored factor in explaining human capital accumulation during college. We conduct the first study, to our knowledge, of how mental health predicts academic success during college in a random longitudinal sample of students. We find that depression is a significant predictor of lower GPA and higher probability of dropping out, particularly among students who also have a positive screen for an anxiety disorder. In within-person estimates using our longitudinal sample, we find again that co-occurring depression and anxiety are associated with lower GPA, and we find that symptoms of eating disorders are also associated with lower GPA. <a href="https://www.apmreports.org/episode/2021/08/19/under-pressure-the-college-mental-health-crisis">Continue Read by Daniel Eisenberg /asha Aslanian here</a></p></div>

				<div id="notas"><h2>Self Care</h2><p>Self-care is important to maintaining a healthy relationship with yourself. It means doing things to take care of our minds, bodies, and souls by engaging in activities that promote well-being and reduce stress. Activities are a great way for us to distract ourselves from our current emotions until we are better able to cope. Likewise, mindfulness has been found to positively affect well-being (Brown & Ryan, 2003).Plant care is self care <a href="https://www.espoma.com/gardening/indoor-gardening/plant-care-can-also-be-self-care/">Continue Read by Espoma</a></p></div> 
				
			  
				<div id="notas"><h2>Asking For Help</h2><p>Asking for help often makes people feel uneasy because it requires surrendering control to someone else. Another fear is being perceived as needy. We don’t want to be ashamed of our situation, or come across as incompeten.  With practice, you’ll get used to asking for help.  For example, speaking up if you need help connecting to a video call, or asking a neighbor to pick up a food item you need on their next grocery run. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/how-to-ask-for-help-mental-health-care/">Continue Read by Cory / Renee Fabian Here </a></p></div>
